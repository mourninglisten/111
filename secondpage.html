      <h1>angels like me don’t fall — we’re pushed. and when i landed, i took heaven down with me.</h1><br>
      <p>
        i go by many names, most of which were never really mine — just borrowed identities stitched together by who people needed me to be. but for now… just call me the girl who walked out of the chapel with blood on her knees, mascara in her tears, and a diary clutched like a weapon. the prayers they made me whisper never reached heaven, so i started writing instead. not for god, but for the girl i was before they took her voice.<br><br>

        i’m seventeen — soft in the ways that hurt and sharp in the ways they never expected. i go by she/her, and i’ve always been more emotion than logic, more moonlight than sun. born under a july sky, cancer sun, always aching for things that are already gone. i love too hard, dream too much, and break in quiet, inconvenient ways. sometimes i romanticize my suffering just to feel like it meant something. sometimes i make it beautiful so no one sees how bad it really was.<br><br>

        i write to stay breathing. it’s never been about art. it’s always been about survival. everything you’ll find here — every word, every paragraph — is a version of me that once begged to be hidden. pieces of a girl i buried, resurrected, rewrote. this isn’t a blog. it’s a graveyard. or maybe it’s an altar, i’m not sure which.<br><br>

        this space is for thoughts too heavy for my chest, and memories too blurred to say out loud. it’s messy. it’s dramatic. it’s tender in ways i don’t always understand. but above all else—it’s mine.<br><br>
     <p class="cinzel">things i love (too much that i ache without them)</p><br>
      <p>
i keep pink skies and barbie dreams tucked in the corners of my mind-remnants of a girlhood i never fully lived but always longed for. there's something about pastel sunsets and artificial perfection that makes me feel safe, even if i know it's all pretend. i find comfort in stories with ugly truths and beautiful lies. i love narratives that look gentle on the surface but carry something rotten underneath-the kind that whispers, "this is going to hurt, but you'll thank me for it."<br><br>

i gravitate toward trauma fiction, but make it poetic. the kind that doesn't just tell you what happened, but lets you bleed through every line, there's healing in watching a character unravel in ways i'm too afraid to admit i understand. rooftop scenes and slow-burning tragedy live rent-free in my head, there's something about standing on the edge of everything, feeling the weight of a moment that's about to break, that feels like home to me. i romanticize endings too much. <br><br>

i'm always drawn to anything that feels like a bruised heart or a forgotten lullaby. i like things that ache quietly-that don't scream, but linger. things that once meant comfort but now only echo with absence.

i love star motifs, ribbon aesthetics, glittery pain the visual language of my softness. sparkles over scars, lace around grief, and everything that says, "yes, i'm hurting... but at least i'm pretty while i do." <br><br>

my favorite characters are always the misunderstood ones - the morally gray boys with blood on their hands but love in their eyes. the ones ones who were ere never given give a choice, only blame. i see too much of myself in them.

i write and read dramatic paragraphs that hurt on purpose. not because i like the pain, but because it's the only thing that makes me feel real. some words are wounds dressed up as poetry and that's exactly why i need them.<br><br>
      <p class="cinzel">don't interact/befriend me if you are:</p><br>
      <p>
(anti-bl or mock coping fiction.) this space is shaped by queer narratives, found families, and characters surviving things they never deserved. if vou can't respect that, you don't belong here. (vou belittle trauma or pathologize feelings.) some of us are still trying to name what happened to us. we don't need your cold logic or clinical detachment.<br><br>

(you make fun of "cringe" writing or soft aesthetics.) everyone starts somewhere. we all have been 13 once, and sometimes the things you call cringe are the only things keeping someone alive. (passive-aggressive posts / parinig culture.) i don't like when people speak in codes expecting you to decipher their hurt. it feels manipulative, like emotional morse code no one asked for. if something hurts, just say it we deserve softness, not side-eyes in captions.<br><br>

you drain energy & shallow conversations i'm a quiet chaos girlie. i get overwhelmed easily, and toxic energy that's too loud feels like it claws at my skin.

(you're misogynistic, homophobic, or anti-feminine.) if softness threatens you, if pink disgusts you, if you hate when girls cry and write and bleed glitter-then leave, this isn't for you. (you think softness equals weakness.) some of us are gentle because the world tried to destroy us, and we chose not to become it.<br><br>

(immature who can't communicate gently) if you can't express your thoughts without throwing tantrums or being cruel, i'll lovingly log out. i believe in honesty with softness-not emotional bulldozing, we're not children anymore; let's use our words like lace, nor knives. people who force interactions out of politeness

you don't have to pretend to like me. i can feel when it's fake, and it makes everything heavier.<br><br>

don't stay if you invalidate people for not healing "the right way." not all recovery is linear. not everyone wants to be a success story. some of us are still stitching ourselves together in silence.<br><br>
